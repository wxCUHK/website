The Flutter community has made a Simplified Chinese version of the
Flutter site website available at
[https://flutter-io.cn](https://flutter-io.cn).

If you’d like to install Flutter using an [installation
bundle](/docs/development/tools/sdk/archive),
you can replace the domain of the original URL with a trusted mirror
to speed it up. For example:

* Original URL:<br>
  [`https://storage.googleapis.com/{{path}}`](https://storage.googleapis.com/{{path}})

* Mirrored URL:<br>
  [`https://storage.flutter-io.cn/{{path}}`](https://storage.flutter-io.cn/{{path}})

You must also set two environment variables to upgrade Flutter and use the pub
package repository in China. Instructions are below.

## Configuring Flutter to use a mirror site

If you’re installing or using Flutter in China, it may be helpful to use
a trustworthy local mirror site that hosts Flutter’s dependencies.
To instruct the Flutter tool to use an alternate storage location,
you need to set two environment variables, `PUB_HOSTED_URL` and
`FLUTTER_STORAGE_BASE_URL`, before running the `flutter` command.

Taking MacOS or Linux as an example, here are the first few steps in
the setup process for using a mirror site. Run the following in a Bash
shell from the directory where you wish to store your local Flutter clone:


```terminal
$ export PUB_HOSTED_URL=https://pub.flutter-io.cn
$ export FLUTTER_STORAGE_BASE_URL=https://storage.flutter-io.cn
$ git clone -b dev {{site.github}}/flutter/flutter.git
$ export PATH="$PWD/flutter/bin:$PATH"
$ cd ./flutter
$ flutter doctor
```

After these steps, you should be able to continue
[setting up Flutter](/docs/get-started/editor) normally.
From here on, packages fetched by `flutter packages get` are
downloaded from `flutter-io.cn` in any shell where `PUB_HOSTED_URL`
and `FLUTTER_STORAGE_BASE_URL` are set.

The `flutter-io.cn` server is a provisional mirror for Flutter
dependencies and packages maintained by [GDG China]().
The Flutter team cannot guarantee long-term availability of this service.
You’re free to use other mirrors if they become available. If you’re
interested in setting up your own mirror in China, contact
[flutter-dev@googlegroups.com](mailto:flutter-dev@googlegroups.com)
for assistance.

  **Known issue:** Running the Flutter Gallery app from source requires assets hosted on
  a domain this workaround currently doesn't support. You can subscribe
  to [Issue #13763]({{site.github}}/flutter/flutter/issues/13763)
  to receive updates. In the meantime, you can check out Flutter Gallery
  from Google Play or third-party app stores you trust.
