While Android and iOS offer high quality system fonts, one of the most common
requests from designers is to use custom fonts. For example, you may have a
custom-built font from a designer, or maybe you downloaded a font from
[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com).

Flutter works out of the box with custom fonts. You can apply fonts across an
entire app or to individual Widgets.

## Directions

  1. Import the font files
  2. Declare the font in the `pubspec.yaml`
  3. Set a font as the default
  4. Use a font in a specific Widget

## 1. Import the font files

In order to work with a font, you need to import the font files into the
project.  It is common practice to put font files in a `fonts` or `assets`
folder at the root of a Flutter project.

For example, if you want to import the Raleway and Roboto Mono font files into
a project, the folder structure would look like this:

```
awesome_app/
  fonts/
    Raleway-Regular.ttf
    Raleway-Italic.ttf
    RobotoMono-Regular.ttf
    RobotoMono-Bold.ttf
```

## 2. Declare the font in the `pubspec.yaml`

Now that you have a font to work with, you need to tell Flutter where to
find it. You can do so by including a font definition in the `pubspec.yaml`.

```yaml
flutter:
  fonts:
    - family: Raleway
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/Raleway-Regular.ttf
        - asset: fonts/Raleway-Italic.ttf
          style: italic
    - family: RobotoMono
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/RobotoMono-Regular.ttf
        - asset: fonts/RobotoMono-Bold.ttf
          weight: 700
```

### `pubspec.yaml` option definitions

The `family` determines the name of the font, which you use in the
[`fontFamily`]({{site.api}}/flutter/painting/TextStyle/fontFamily.html)
property of a [`TextStyle`]({{site.api}}/flutter/painting/TextStyle-class.html)
object.

The `asset` is a path to the font file, relative to the `pubspec.yaml` file.
These files contain the outlines for the glyphs in the font. When building the
app, these files are included in the app's asset bundle.

A single font can reference many different files with different outline weights
and styles:

  * The `weight` property specifies the weight of the outlines in the file as an
    integer multiple of 100, between 100 and 900. These values correspond to the
    [`FontWeight`]({{site.api}}/flutter/dart-ui/FontWeight-class.html)
    and can be used in the
    [`fontWeight`]({{site.api}}/flutter/painting/TextStyle/fontWeight.html)
    property of a
    [`TextStyle`]({{site.api}}/flutter/painting/TextStyle-class.html) object.

  * The `style` property specifies whether the outlines in the file are
    `italic` or `normal`. These values correspond to the
    [`FontStyle`]({{site.api}}/flutter/dart-ui/FontStyle-class.html)
    and can be used in the
    [fontStyle]({{site.api}}/flutter/painting/TextStyle/fontStyle.html)
    property of a
    [`TextStyle`]({{site.api}}/flutter/painting/TextStyle-class.html) object.

## 3. Set a font as the default

You have two options for how to apply fonts to text: as the default font
or only within specific Widgets.

To use a font as the default, set the `fontFamily` property as part of
the app's `theme`. The value provided to `fontFamily` must match the `family`
name declared in the `pubspec.yaml`.

<!-- skip -->
```dart
MaterialApp(
  title: 'Custom Fonts',
  // Set Raleway as the default app font
  theme: ThemeData(fontFamily: 'Raleway'),
  home: MyHomePage(),
);
```

For more information on themes, please view the ["Using Themes to share colors
and font styles"](/docs/cookbook/design/themes) recipe.

## 4. Use the font in a specific Widget

If you want to apply the font to a specific Widget, such as a `Text` Widget,
provide a [`TextStyle`]({{site.api}}/flutter/painting/TextStyle-class.html)
to the Widget.

In this example, you'll apply the RobotoMono font to a single `Text` Widget.
Once again, the `fontFamily` must match the `family` name declared in the
`pubspec.yaml`.

<!-- skip -->
```dart
Text(
  'Roboto Mono sample',
  style: TextStyle(fontFamily: 'RobotoMono'),
);
```

### TextStyle

If a [`TextStyle`]({{site.api}}/flutter/painting/TextStyle-class.html)
object specifies a weight or style for which is there is no exact font file, the
engine uses one of the more generic files for the font and attempts to
extrapolate outlines for the requested weight and style.

### `pubspec.yaml`

```yaml
name: custom_fonts
description: An example of how to use custom fonts with Flutter

dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter

dev_dependencies:
  flutter_test:
    sdk: flutter

flutter:
  fonts:
    - family: Raleway
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/Raleway-Regular.ttf
        - asset: fonts/Raleway-Italic.ttf
          style: italic
    - family: RobotoMono
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/RobotoMono-Regular.ttf
        - asset: fonts/RobotoMono-Bold.ttf
          weight: 700
  uses-material-design: true
```

### `main.dart`

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() => runApp(MyApp());

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Custom Fonts',
      // Set Raleway as the default app font
      theme: ThemeData(fontFamily: 'Raleway'),
      home: MyHomePage(),
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      // The AppBar uses the app-default Raleway font
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Custom Fonts')),
      body: Center(
        // This Text Widget uses the RobotoMono font
        child: Text(
          'Roboto Mono sample',
          style: TextStyle(fontFamily: 'RobotoMono'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
