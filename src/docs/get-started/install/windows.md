## System requirements

To install and run Flutter, your development environment must meet these minimum requirements:

- **Operating Systems**: Windows 7 SP1 or later (64-bit)
- **Disk Space**: 400 MB (does not include disk space for IDE/tools).
- **Tools**: Flutter depends on these tools being available in your environment.
  - [Windows PowerShell 5.0][] or newer (this is pre-installed with Windows 10)
  - [Git for Windows][] 2.x, with the **Use Git from the Windows Command Prompt** option.

     If Git for Windows is already installed, make sure you can run `git` commands from the
     command prompt or PowerShell.
