  The `flutter` tool uses Google Analytics to anonymously report feature usage statistics
  and basic crash reports. This data is used to help improve Flutter tools over time.
  Analytics is not sent on the very first run or for any runs involving `flutter config`,
  so you can opt out of analytics before any data is sent. To disable reporting,
  type `flutter config --no-analytics` and to display the current setting, type
  `flutter config`. See Google's [Privacy Policy].
