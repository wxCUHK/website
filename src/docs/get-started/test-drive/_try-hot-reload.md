After the app build completes, you'll see the starter app on your device.

## Try hot reload

Flutter offers a fast development cycle with _hot reload_, the ability to reload
the code of a live running app without restarting or losing app state.
Make a change to app source, tell your IDE or command-line tool that you
want to hot reload, and see the change in your simulator, emulator, or device.

 1. Open `lib/main.dart`.
 1. Change the string

    {% prettify dart %}
      'You have [[strike]]pushed[[/strike]] the button this many times'
    {% endprettify %}

    to

    {% prettify dart %}
      'You have [!clicked!] the button this many times'
    {% endprettify %}

    {{site.alert.important}}
      Do _not_ stop your app. Let your app run.
    {{site.alert.end}}

 1. Save your changes{{include.save_changes}}

You'll see the updated string in the running app almost immediately.
